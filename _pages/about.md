I am a Senior Data Engineer working on large-scale data systems that support applied machine learning and scientific research. I currently work at Amgen, where I design and operate reliable data platforms for R&D and drug discovery teams.

I have over eight years of experience building production data pipelines, distributed compute workflows, and cloud-based analytics platforms across healthcare, finance, and enterprise environments. My work focuses on creating trustworthy and well-structured data that supports research, experimentation, and decision-making.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science, where my graduate research focused on machine learning for healthcare, including predictive modeling for chronic kidney disease. This research background continues to shape how I approach data engineering, with an emphasis on data quality, reproducibility, and clarity.

I enjoy working at the boundary between research and production systems and mentoring engineers through technical growth and collaboration. For a detailed professional history, please refer to my CV.
