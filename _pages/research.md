## Research & Applied Work

My research interests lie at the intersection of data engineering, applied machine learning, and healthcare analytics. I am particularly interested in how well-designed data pipelines, feature engineering, and validation frameworks can improve the reliability and interpretability of predictive models in real-world settings.

My work spans graduate research and applied research in industry, with a focus on building reproducible data workflows that support scientific analysis and downstream machine learning.


### Kidney Ailment Prediction Under Data Imbalance

As part of my Master’s research in Computer Science, I developed a machine learning model to predict chronic kidney disease using large-scale public health datasets. The project focused on transforming raw clinical and demographic data into structured feature sets suitable for modeling and evaluation.

I built automated data preprocessing pipelines using Python, Pandas, and NumPy, and trained classification models using scikit-learn and XGBoost. To address class imbalance common in clinical datasets, I applied SMOTE-based sampling strategies, which improved minority class recall and overall model robustness. The work emphasized careful feature preparation, evaluation metrics relevant to healthcare outcomes, and reproducibility of experiments.

This project shaped my long-term interest in healthcare analytics and continues to influence how I design data systems for research and AI-ready platforms in industry.

### Applied Research in Industry

In my professional work, I collaborate closely with scientists, analysts, and engineers to design data platforms that support research analytics and exploratory modeling. This includes building governed data pipelines, validation frameworks, and transformation layers that enable reliable experimentation while meeting production and compliance requirements.
