I am a Senior Data Engineer working at the intersection of large-scale data systems, applied machine learning, and scientific research. I currently work at Amgen, where I support R&D and drug discovery teams by designing and operating reliable, governed, and scalable data platforms that enable research analytics and downstream AI/ML workflows.

My background spans healthcare, finance, and enterprise analytics, with over eight years of experience building production-grade data pipelines, distributed compute workflows, and cloud-native data platforms. I specialize in transforming complex, high-volume data into trustworthy, well-modeled datasets that can be used confidently for research, experimentation, and decision-making. My work emphasizes reproducibility, observability, and data quality as first-class concerns.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science, where my graduate research focused on machine learning for healthcare, including predictive modeling for chronic kidney disease using large public health datasets. This research experience continues to shape how I approach data engineering problems—treating data pipelines not only as operational systems, but as foundations for rigorous analysis and scientific inquiry.

Beyond hands-on engineering, I am deeply interested in building systems that bridge research and production, particularly in environments where data quality, governance, and scalability directly impact scientific outcomes. I also enjoy mentoring engineers, sharing technical knowledge, and contributing to collaborative engineering cultures.
